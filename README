Regression-Classifier-for-Image-Recognition

A coding in Octave, also compatible with Matlab that allows binary classification of images 
based on Logistic Regression classifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

OCTAVE TOOL with image processing tool installed

PROCEDURE:

Unzip the REGCLASS file to the bin directory in the Octave folder

Put the images for training/test data as 200x200 pixels grayscale images in the IMGBACKUP folder

Replace the existing names with the names of the images in the datasett file

Replace the BASKETBALL/NOT BASKETBALL in the exercise file with required classifier

Run the Octave program

Switch to the directory using cd C:\Octave\3.2.4_gcc-4.4.0\bin\self command

Type exercise in the command prompt

Follow the prompt

Enter the name of the file you want to identify

Repeat the last step for all the classifications
