Regression-Classifier-for-Image-Recognition

A coding in Octave, also compatible with Matlab that allows binary classification of images 
based on Logistic Regression classifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

OCTAVE TOOL with image processing tool installed

PROCEDURE:

Unzip the REGCLASS file to the bin directory in the Octave folder

Put the images for training/test data as grayscale images of any size in the IMGBACKUP folder

Replace the existing names with the names of the images in the datasett file

Replace the BASKETBALL/NOT BASKETBALL in the exercise file with required classifier

Run the Octave program

Switch to the directory using cd C:\Octave\3.2.4_gcc-4.4.0\bin\self command

Type exercise in the command prompt

Follow the prompt

Enter the name of the file you want to identify

Repeat the last step for all the classifications

UPDATE:

The regressionclassifiernew set of programs are capable of handling any image of any size and can be used widely 
for any classification 

Follow the same procedure as above with any image of your discretion

The compatibility with MATLAB is restricted to a few older versions and will be updated soon 
Octave is an open source mathematical tool which can be downloaded and installed for free from the internet 
from the following link
http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html

The installation can be carried out with default options except inclusion of image property.
